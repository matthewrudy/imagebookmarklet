# Info

This is my attempt at recreating the Pinterest bookmarklet. It detects all the inline and background images on a page over a certain size and overlays them in a grid. Each picture links to the original file.

To get it to work add a bookmark to your browser and set the address to be:

     javascript:void((function(){var e=document.createElement('script');e.setAttribute('type','text/javascript');e.setAttribute('charset','UTF-8');e.setAttribute('src','http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5045906/imagesbookmarklet/bookmarklet.js?r='+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)})());

If you wish to edit your own version of the bookmarklet you'll have to change this location and that of the css file.
